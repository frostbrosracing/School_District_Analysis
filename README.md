# A Comprehensive Analyisis of a School District

## Project Overview of the District Analysis
#### This project was completed to provide insights to school district administrators about performance trends and patterns among high schools in the district.  In order for key personnel to make strategic decisions at the school and district level, a wide range of data were collected and evaluated.  Once completed, it was discovered that there was evidence of academic dishonesty involving both the math and reading scores within a grade level at one of the high schools in the district.  Because of this, it was necessary to repeat the analysis with those suspect scores being removed from the results and the rest of the data remaining intact.  The scope of this project included the following summaries:
  1.  An overall per school summary for the district
  2.  The highest and lowest performing schools
  3.  A summary of the math scores by grade
  4.  A summary of the reading scores by grade
  5.  A summary of scores by school spending
  6.  A summary of scores by school size
  7.  A summary of scores by school type
